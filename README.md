#CNV analysis scripts

Calculate the per genomic position depth of coverage with coverageAnalysis.sh. Afterewards use analyseCoverage.R to plot the pair wise Fold Change.

Calculate the per gene depth of coverage with countReadsPerGene-CNV_Analysis.sh. Afterewards use analyseCoverage.R to plot the pair wise Fold Change for genes.

Use cnMOPS_FinalScript.R to make a CNV analysis using cnMOPS bioconductor module
